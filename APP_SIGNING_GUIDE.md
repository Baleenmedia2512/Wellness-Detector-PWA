            storeFile file('wellness-buddy-keystore.jks')

            keyAlias 'wellness-buddy'
            keyPassword 'YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD'
        }
    }
    
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
            minifyEnabled false
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
